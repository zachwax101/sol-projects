# Crowdfund Project

## Setup

See [README-Setup.md](./README-Setup.md)

## Technical Spec

<!-- Here is the list the technical requirements of the project. We include them here by default for your first project, but for future projects we encourage you to develop a healthy habit of thinking + writing out the project specs in your README. You may find you come up with additional specifications, in which case you should add them here.

The goal here is to help you think through the possible edge cases of all your contracts -->

## Design Exercise Answer

<!-- Answer the Design Exercise. -->
<!-- In your answer: (1) Consider the tradeoffs of your design, and (2) provide some pseudocode, or a diagram, to illustrate how one would get started. -->

> Smart contracts have a hard limit of 24kb. Crowdfundr hands out an NFT to everyone who contributes. However, consider how Kickstarter has multiple contribution tiers. How would you design your contract to support this, without creating three separate NFT contracts?
