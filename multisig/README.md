# Multisig Project

## Deliverables

My Gnosis Safe can be found here the Etherscan URL: `FILL_ME_IN`

Contracts have been deployed to Goerli at the following addresses:

| Contract      | Address Etherscan Link |
| ------------- | ---------------------- |
| Proxy         | `FILL_ME_IN`           |
| Logic         | `FILL_ME_IN`           |
| LogicImproved | `FILL_ME_IN`           |

Transaction for transferring the ownership of the **Proxy** contract to the multisig:

| Contract | Transaction Etherscan Link |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| Proxy    | `FILL_ME_IN`               |

Transaction calling `upgrade(address)` to upgrade the **Proxy** from **Logic** -> **LogicImproved**
| Contract | Function called | Transaction Etherscan Link |
| --------------- | --------------- | -- |
| Proxy | `upgrade` | `FILL_ME_IN` |

The proxy contract at address 0xED579ea390850d51E075De736f88bc0D478F70E7 on Goerli points to a logic contract at address `FILL_ME_IN`.

# Design exercise

> Consider and write down the positive and negative tradeoffs of the following configurations for a multisig wallet. In particular, consider how each configuration handles the common failure modes of wallet security.

> - 1-of-N
> - M-of-N (where M: such that 1 < M < N)
> - N-of-N
